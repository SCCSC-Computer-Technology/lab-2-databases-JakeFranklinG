Code Review of Jake Gentry Lab 2

Nicholas Chapman-Miller

	The code compiles with no errors or warnings. The code is very readable and clean, I like the documentation. I think the documentation could get a little more specific with the comments on the TotalPopAverage and HighestLowest methods, just explaining how they work in simple terms. 

	I could not find any bugs/software defects. No crashing no matter the user input, great job! All the buttons have shortcuts too so that is good.
	
	One way your solution differed from mine is that you used foreach loops to search for the highest or lowest populations. I used SQL queries in the designer in my solution since it is easier for me, but I like your application of linear searching through the rows in the table because it is more creative. I also like how you put your searching/math functions into methods so the button code is cleaner/more readable. Program is clean and works well, I have no more feedback, good job!!
