Hello, Jake, this is what I have to say after looking through your code. I like how your GUI is set up, with bordered labels to display the average/total/etc. and the buttons
do exactly what they are supposed to. I also noticed that rather than using the SQL code for the average and highest/lowest methods like I did, you used void methods, which is interesting to see.
The code is documented well, with comments and variable names indicated throughout. The ascending and descending methods are very similar to how I did, using the SQL code mentioned earlier. I experienced no issues
at all when testing your program. I have nothing else to say, you did a good job with this.
